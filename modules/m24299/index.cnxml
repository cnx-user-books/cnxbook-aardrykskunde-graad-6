      <para id="id8256397">1. The Influence of the Spice Trade</para>
      <list id="id8489241" list-type="bulleted">
        <item>When the spices of the Far East were discovered, the Arabs were the first merchants to transport and sell these sought-after products. They traded with merchants from the wealthy Roman Empire at first, and later sold their precious goods to all who could afford them. It was regarded as a symbol of wealth to have spices on one’s table. Venice, a very prosperous Italian city with a powerful naval base, saw a gap in the market and through their participation in the Crusades forced all spice merchants to move through the Venetian ports. Later Venice controlled every aspect of the spice trade, fixed the prices and became very rich. Spices became so expensive that it was almost impossible to buy them, with the result that the other European countries decided to make an effort to find another sea route to the East, so that they could buy their own spices directly from the original merchants.</item>
        <item>The Portuguese, with their excellent naval skills, took the lead and as early as 1497 they sailed around the southernmost tip of Africa on their way to the East. Wherever they found spices they simply seized them, and instantly killed any of the local inhabitants who offered any resistance. </item>
      </list>
      <para id="id5748568">2. Colonisation</para>
      <list id="id8073701" list-type="bulleted">
        <item>Other European countries also set out on voyages of discovery with the main aim of discovering and occupying new territory. Countries such as Britain, the Netherlands and Belgium simply claimed territory for themselves without taking the indigenous population into account. The occupiers then proclaimed these occupied territories as their own “colonies”. </item>
        <item>In this way the Dutch established themselves here in South Africa with the main objective of providing fresh fruit and vegetables for the passing ships. The greatest part of Africa, as well as the Americas, India, New Zealand and Australia were gradually taken over and colonised in this way. </item>
      </list>
      <para id="id2714056">The settlers from Europe simply appropriated (took for their own use) all the raw materials that were to be found in the colonies without compensating the indigenous people. In this way gold, diamonds, silver, timber and spices were taken to European countries from the colonies. Mozambique, a former Portuguese colony, is a very good example of what happened in that era. For 500 years, from 1505 to 1975 when Mozambique was a Portuguese colony, most of its resources were exploited by other countries. </para>
      <list id="id4022775" list-type="bulleted">
        <item>When the colonies became independent during the middle of the twentieth century, the new, independent states were not properly developed at all. In general, the people were not really highly literate and skills were not properly developed. The transport infrastructure was poor or non-existent. The colonists left behind them depilated mines, instead of developed industries. No attention had been given to the training of local managers for companies, banks, schools, mines or even administration. The companies that had been founded in the colonies had enriched the European countries, but had not brought any financial gains for the indigenous people. The colonists (foreigners who had occupied the country) had seen to it that there were good schools for their own children, but they had given no attention to the education and training of the local populace. </item>
        <item>Today most of the former colonies are still extremely badly off. Their economies are very poorly developed. They have been forced to build up their impoverished countries, which had been robbed of their raw materials, without the skills and the money of the colonists.</item>
      </list>
      <para id="id8263401">3. The European Renaissance (re-awakening)</para>
      <list id="id8471946" list-type="bulleted">
        <item>Many European countries became wealthy as a result of the spice trade, and paid academics and students a great deal of money to do research. The research results were applied to establish products of a better quality, better financial services and a higher standard of education. These countries developed rapidly, but they did not pass their knowledge and expertise to the colonies. </item>
        <item>Poor people were used to manufacture and produce goods, but they were paid very low wages. These products were sold back to the local people of the colonies from where the raw materials had initially been taken. </item>
        <item>The income of the countries from which the raw materials had been taken – the colonies – was not increased, while the colonial powers, the European countries to which the colonies belonged, grew richer. Europe became wealthier as time went by, while the indigenous people of the colonies became more and more impoverished. The living conditions in the European cities improved greatly and both medical and educational services were of a very high standard.</item>
        <item>By now you will have realised that the withdrawal of the colonists caused a tremendous need for development.</item>

          <item>As Europe became increasingly powerful economically and financially, more and more machines were developed to do the work in factories faster and on a greater scale. The machines brought about a total revolution in the field of industry. Now, less human labour was needed, and the machines were able to manufacture the goods much more cheaply than before. The machines provided cheaper labour than the workers in the colonies and other countries had previously been able to do.</item>
          <item>England and other European countries took steel out of the African colonies, used it to mass-produce products and then exported these products to the colonies and other countries. In this way the inhabitants of the colonies bought products that had been manufactured from their own raw materials, and for which they had received no compensation.</item>

        <para id="id8478664">LAGOS – According to president Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, African leaders have stolen almost $140 billion (about R1 400 billion) from the continent in the past three or four decades.</para>
        <para id="id4147407">On Thursday, in Addis Abeba, the capital city of Ethiopia, Obasanjo said that theft was the main cause of poverty in Africa.</para>
        <para id="id8279266">He was addressing delegates from African communities at a conference of the Organisation of African Unity.</para>
        <para id="id8475841">Obasanjo also called on world leaders to support Africa in its attempts to recover a part of this stolen money that is hoarded in bank accounts in foreign countries.</para>
        <para id="id8488527">He said that African leaders were the main culprits but Western countries that held this stolen money, must also accept part of the responsibility.</para>
        <para id="id5156319">He said, “We are attempting to organise an international convention, by which we will be able to recover the moneys stolen by corrupt African leaders and invested in foreign countries.”</para>
        <para id="id4833679">“It is not enough to merely blame the developing countries,” Obasanjo said.</para>
        <para id="id8473804">“Western countries must support the attempts made to recover the money stolen from our treasuries in practice,” he added.</para>
        <para id="id8493922">For example, an amount of about $4 billion (about R40 billion) disappeared during the administration of General Sani Abacha of Nigeria. Recently an undertaking to recover part of this money was concluded in the Swiss city of Geneva.</para>

On the contrary, the standard of living in the poor countries is usually very low, and people earn a meagre income. Many of the inhabitants of these countries are undernourished and do not have basic commodities such as health services and proper educational facilities. Approximately 80% of the total world population live in the poor South, while the other 20% enjoy the comfort, wealth and space of the wealthy countries.</para>
